## Abstract Classes ##

## AsyncAwait ##

## S in SOLID ##
* Single Responsibility Principle (The S in SOLID)
* There should be only one reason to change the class.

## O in SOLID ##
* Open Closed Principle 
* Closed for modification but open for extension
* If Code is working don't modify and introduce new bugs 

## L in SOLID ##
* Liskov Substitution Principle (The L in SOLID)
* If S is a subtype of T then object of type T maybe replaced with object of Type S without breaking the program. 

## I in SOLID ##
